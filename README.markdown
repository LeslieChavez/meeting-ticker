# Meeting-Ticker: Hey! Meetings Cost Money

While consulting, I had a client that really liked to waste time in
meetings.  A dozen or more _expensive_ consultants sitting on their
rears for hours at a time.  So, one day during one of these marathon
yawn-fests, I whipped up a quick piece of javascript that displayed an
estimate of the meeting's current cost as time progressed.  People
were shocked to see the dollars quickly climb into the thousands.

Big IT shops being what they are, nothing really changed **but** at
least now we were having fun.  Picking up the ball, Roy Kolak wrote an
animated odometer display and things got out of hand from there.


## Using the Meeting-Ticker

Hopefully, is pretty easy to figure out:

1. Count the number of people in the room
2. Take a wild guess at how much they cost an hour
3. Click Start
4. Have a meaningful discussion about whether the value of your
meeting exceeds its cost

## Oh No! It doesn't work in IE!

Yeah, I only work on IE if I'm getting paid for it.

I'll accept contributions that fix it in IE, but I can't promise I'll
maintain it that way.

Sorry, I don't like IE and neither should you.
